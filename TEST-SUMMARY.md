# Test Summary

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy and test coverage for the application.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized in the `src/__tests__` directory, mirroring the structure of the source code:

```
src/__tests__/

├── components/      # Tests for components
│   ├── contexts/    # Tests for context providers
│   └── ui/          # Tests for UI components
├── helpers/         # Tests for helper functions
│   └── fetch/       # Tests for API fetch utilities
├── hooks/           # Tests for custom hooks
├── stores/          # Tests for state stores
└── util/            # Tests for utility functions
```

## Testing Tools and Setup

- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: DOM testing utilities for React components
- **User Event**: Advanced simulation of user interactions
- **Mock Service Worker**: API request mocking (prepared for future expansion)

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests with coverage report:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Future Test Improvements

Areas for future test expansion:

1. Additional UI component tests for the remaining 14 components
2. Integration tests for complex component interactions
3. E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright
4. More extensive app routes testing
5. Comprehensive form validation testing
6. API request mocking for more complex data fetching scenarios
7. Testing for advanced hooks like use-toast and query hooks
8. Snapshot tests for UI components to detect unintended changes

## Test Files

I created the following test files:

1. **src/**tests**/hooks/query/use-query-api.test.ts** - Tests for the useQueryApi hook
2. **src/**tests**/hooks/query/use-infinite-query-api.test.ts** - Tests for the useInfiniteQueryApi hook
3. **src/**tests**/hooks/query/use-mutation-api.test.ts** - Tests for the useMutationApi hook
4. **src/**tests**/test-utils.tsx** - Shared utilities for tests, including QueryClient wrapper
5. **src/**tests**/test-utils.test.tsx** - Tests for the test utilities
